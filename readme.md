# E-Commerce Microservices Platform

This project aims to build a basic e-commerce platform using three distinct microservices. The platform follows the principles of **clean architecture** and best practices for software design, and is implemented using **Gin** for the API Gateway and service layers. The three core services are:

1. **API Gateway** - Handles routing, logging, telemetry, and authentication.
2. **Inventory Service** - Manages product inventory, categories, stock levels, and prices.
3. **Order Service** - Handles order creation, updates, payments, and order tracking.
